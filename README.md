Horlings et al. dataset. A preprocessed version of the Horlings array-CGH dataset is included in this repository so users can directly apply the TAaCGH algorithm and the extended pipeline described in this study. The dataset is redistributed in processed form for reproducibility and educational use only.

SCAN-B (GSE96058) dataset. Normalized RNA-seq expression data and corresponding clinical metadata were obtained from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; accession GSE96058). The scripts in this repository demonstrate how to retrieve, clean, and process the official data files following the R data package workflow described in https://12379monty.github.io/GSE96058/. To keep this repository lightweight and in compliance with data redistribution policies, only small, de-identified example subsets are included. The full dataset must be downloaded directly from the original GEO source. Mutation data were incorporated using files downloaded from the SCAN-B Mutation Explorer: https://oncogenomics.bmc.lu.se/MutationExplorer/.

TCGA dataset. Open-access files were obtained from the NCI Genomic Data Commons (GDC). In the respective folder, we provide scripts to download the official files directly from the GDC API and to reproduce all preprocessing into the matrices used by this study. We include only small, de-identified example subsets in this repository to keep the repo light and avoid duplicating large third-party datasets.
