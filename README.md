Horlings et al. dataset. A preprocessed version of the Horlings array-CGH dataset is included in this repository so users can directly apply the TAaCGH algorithm and the extended pipeline described in this study. The dataset is redistributed in processed form for reproducibility and educational use only.

SCAN-B (GSE96058) dataset. Normalized RNA-seq expression and clinical tables were obtained from NCBI GEO (accession GSE96058). In the respective folder, we provide scripts to download the official files directly from GEO and to reproduce all preprocessing. We include only small, de-identified example subsets in this repository to keep the repo light and avoid duplicating large third-party datasets.

TCGA dataset. Open-access files were obtained from the NCI Genomic Data Commons (GDC). In the respective folder, we provide scripts to download the official files directly from the GDC API and to reproduce all preprocessing into the matrices used by this study. We include only small, de-identified example subsets in this repository to keep the repo light and avoid duplicating large third-party datasets.
